**Note:** Google Project ID and Vertex AI Models are configured in "backend/config.yml". 

# Dependencies
This project relies on several external libraries.Create a virtual environment and install all the required dependencies.

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

Install Dependencies in the virtual environment created:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will download and install all the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

# Running the Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running:
