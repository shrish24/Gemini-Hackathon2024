    ## UX Design Principles Comparison Report
    
    **Introduction:**
    
    This report compares multiple provided images, based on core UX design principles. The goal is to identify which image offers a better user experience (UX) by analyzing their strengths and weaknesses.
    
    1. **Evaluation Criteria:** We will evaluate the images based on the following UX design principles:
    
        - **Balance:** Balance refers to the arrangement of elements in a way that feels visually stable and harmonious. It can be symmetrical (elements mirrored across a center line) or asymmetrical (elements balanced with different weights).
        - **Emphasis:** This principle focuses on drawing attention to specific elements within the design. Techniques like size, color, contrast, and isolation can be used to highlight key information or calls to action.
        - **Proportion:** Proportion refers to the relative size and scale of elements in relation to each other. Maintaining proper proportion creates a sense of order and visual hierarchy.
        - **Repetition:** Repeating design elements throughout the interface creates a sense of unity and consistency. This can be through consistent use of colors, fonts, icons, or layout patterns.
        - **Rhythm:** Rhythm creates a sense of visual flow and movement in the design. This can be achieved through repetition of elements with variations in size, spacing, or color.
        - **Pattern:** Patterns are recurring visual arrangements that help users understand the structure and organization of the interface. They can improve learnability and predictability.
        - **Whitespace (Negative Space):** Whitespace, or negative space, refers to the empty areas between elements. Using whitespace effectively helps to avoid clutter and improves readability.
        - **Movement:** Movement can be used to create a sense of dynamism and guide the user's attention. This can be through subtle animations, micro-interactions, or video elements.
        - **Variety:** While consistency is important, incorporating some variety can keep the user engaged. This can be achieved through subtle variations in color, typography, or layout elements.
        - **Unity:** Unity refers to the overall feeling of cohesion and coherence within the design. All elements should work together to create a unified and consistent visual experience.

    2. **Evaluation Process:**
    
        - Each principle will be scored on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Evaluators will provide clear justifications for their assigned scores for each image.
        - Scores for each image across all principles will be averaged in percentage to provide a holistic UX rating.
    
    3. **Data Presentation:
        - The evaluation results should include summarizing the scores for each principle and the average UX rating for each image.
    
    **Deliverables:**
    
    - Principles Scores and clear justifications for their assigned scores for each image.
    - A written analysis detailing the strengths and weaknesses of each image based on UX design principles. This analysis should leverage the assigned scores and justifications.
    - A recommendation on which image provides a superior user experience based on the evaluation and average UX rating.
    - Actionable Recommendations:
        Based on the evaluation, Gemini can provide detailed points outlining specific changes that can be made to both Image 1 and Image 2 to further enhance user experience. These recommendations will be tailored to address the identified weaknesses in each image while adhering to core UX design principles.
    - Format the output as JSON string capturing introduction. Make sure output is a well-formatted JSON. Use double quote for attributes and values
    - The JSON output should comprise of the following:
        - Summary of what the report is about
        - Evaluation - Principles scores along with clear justifications for their assigned scores for each image, example: Evaluation": {"Image_1": {"Balance": {"Score": 8,"Justification": ""}}}
        - Average UX Rating
        - Strengths and Weakness for both the images
        - Actionable_recommendation
        - Result Summary specifying which image performed better and why
    
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    Based on the report's findings, you can choose to:
    
    - Implement the recommended image.
    - Refine both the images based on the identified weaknesses and Gemini's actionable recommendations to create a more user-centric design.
    - Provide detailed points based on the changes which can be made in both the images to achieve good UX ratings.Keep in mind the UX principles.

    Choose fonts that enhance readability and align with the webpage's design aesthetic.
    Define consistent font sizes for different elements, using relative units for scalability.
    Choose font colors that harmonize with the webpage's overall color scheme, including the hero section.

    Integration with Hero Section:
    Ensure that button styling blends seamlessly with the hero section design, using similar colors, fonts, or visual elements.

    Provide summaries for each icon or image to enhance accessibility.

    Additional Considerations:
    Maintain balanced layout to prevent any element from dominating excessively, including hero image and header.
